🌿 Project WildX - Wildlife Data Exploration and Visualization
📊 By Team Data Minions
📌 Overview
WildX is a comprehensive data analytics project focused on understanding wildlife characteristics and conservation patterns through visual exploration. The project analyzes animal traits like diet, lifespan, weight, gestation period, and conservation status using diagnostic and comparative analytics techniques.

🧠 Objectives
Understand correlations between animal traits and conservation status.

Visualize patterns using descriptive and diagnostic analysis.

Identify trends across animal families and habitats.

Create an intuitive visual representation of key metrics for ecological insights.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Google Collab

CSV Dataset

Data Visualization Tools

📷 Visual Analytics
1. Comparison of Average Lifespan by Diet
Shows how dietary habits affect average lifespan among species.


2. Average Lifespan, Weight, and Height per Animal Family
Multivariate view per family group highlighting biological differences.

3. Conservation Status vs. Habitat
Displays how conservation status correlates with diverse habitat types.


4. Conservation Status vs. Gestation Period
Highlights how reproductive characteristics may relate to risk status.


5. Distribution by Conservation Status
Shows the frequency distribution of animals across various IUCN categories.

🌍 Significance
Understanding these patterns can:

Aid wildlife conservation strategies.

Provide insights for ecological researchers.

Support predictive models in environmental science.
